# Everything in this file will be hidden from the client. The main part of our
# project will be implementing a unique and novel minimax algorithm (or genetic)
# that builds upon our connect four GUI to create an AI player that can win over
# 90% of the time. We will import this minimax algorithm to board.py in order
# to have the AI implement this method at every turn

# We will look 5 turns ahead to determine the best method. We will expose AI
# difficulty but nothing else in order to keep the AI formula hidden from the 
# player

# Minimax will take in the difficulty as an input, but nothing else (we assume
# this will have to be implented as an if else clause for different states)
